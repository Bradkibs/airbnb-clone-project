# Airbnb Clone Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This is my **full-stack clone of Airbnb**, where I set out to build a fully functional booking platform. The app lets users browse properties, view detailed listings, and make bookings — all from a responsive and modern UI. Throughout this project, I handled everything from the UI/UX design to the backend, database, and deployment setup.

## 🎯 What I Aim to Achieve
With this project, my goals are to:
- Build a **responsive and intuitive interface** that feels like a real-world product
- Gain hands-on experience **structuring a complex web application**
- Strengthen my skills working in a **team setting** (even if simulated) with clearly defined roles
- Deepen my knowledge of **component-driven frontend architecture**
- Follow **industry best practices** across the entire app

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities
Since this is a solo learning project, I wear many hats — I plan the features, design the UI, build the components and API, write tests, and also take care of deployment and DevOps. In a team setting, these would typically look like:

| Role             | What They’d Do                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Oversee the timeline and deliverables               |
| **Frontend Devs**   | Implement UI components and make sure it’s responsive |
| **Backend Devs**    | Build APIs and data models                         |
| **Designers**       | Develop the look and feel of the UI                |
| **QA/Testers**      | Test the app and report issues                    |
| **DevOps**          | Handle deployment, servers, and CI/CD             |
| **Product Owner**   | Define features and priorities                    |
| **Scrum Master**    | Keep the process smooth and help resolve blockers |

## 🧩 UI Component Patterns
Here are some reusable components I plan to implement:
- **Navbar**: Logo, search bar, user menu
- **Property Card**: Image, price, location, rating, favorite
- **Footer**: Site links, company info, social media

💡 That’s my plan!  
Let me know if you’d also like me to add setup commands, screenshots, or deployment instructions — I’m always looking to improve this as the project grows.
