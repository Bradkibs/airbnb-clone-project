# Airbnb Clone Project

## 📖 Project Overview

This is my full-stack clone of Airbnb, where I’m building a responsive booking platform. Users can browse property listings, view detailed listings, and make bookings seamlessly. Throughout this project, I’m applying real-world practices — UI/UX design, component-driven architecture, backend services, and deployment — to deepen my skills as a developer.

- Implement a **responsive UI** that’s intuitive and enjoyable to use
- Get hands-on experience structuring a **complex web app**
- Strengthen my skills with **component-based design** and reusability
- Explore **best practices** for version control, accessibility, and testing
- Build a product that feels like a real-world Airbnb alternative
