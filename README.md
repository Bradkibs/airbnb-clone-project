# Airbnb Clone Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This is my **full-stack clone of Airbnb**, where I set out to build a fully functional booking platform. The app lets users browse properties, view detailed listings, and make bookings — all from a responsive and modern UI. Throughout this project, I handled everything from the UI/UX design to the backend, database, and deployment setup.

## 🎯 What I Aim to Achieve
With this project, my goals are to:
- Build a **responsive and intuitive interface** that feels like a real-world product
- Gain hands-on experience **structuring a complex web application**
- Strengthen my skills working in a **team setting** (even if simulated) with clearly defined roles
- Deepen my knowledge of **component-driven frontend architecture**
- Follow **industry best practices** across the entire app
